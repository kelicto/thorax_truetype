Thorax Truetype is a library for loading and rendering TrueType fonts.  This
project grew out of a pedagogical exercise to have an easy to understand
TrueType loader.  My desire to do so came from stb_truetype being difficult
to understand due to a lack of C++ features or type punning (the address
computations required to index into the truetype tables are pretty
incomprehensible as inline C code) and the size of the opentype loader.

The loader consists of two files:
  thorax_truetype.h
  thorax_truetype.cpp

In addition to the font loader, this project contains a font rasterizer in the
renderer folder.  The rasterizer uses a novel coverage algorithm and is capable
of generated nicely anti-aliased renderings.

The files in the renderer:
  build.h         : interface for managing text scenes
  bvh.cpp         : implementation of bounding volume hierarchy builders
  drawcontext.h   : context interface for drawing text to a bitmap
  drawcontext.cpp : context implementation for drawing text to a bitmap
  types.h         : a variety of helper datatypes

A more detailed description of the rasterizer will come later.
